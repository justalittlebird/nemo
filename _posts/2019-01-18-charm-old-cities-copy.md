Elon Musk’s SpaceX has made it clear that, when it colonizes Mars, people there will not be bound by our puny Earth laws.
The terms of service for its Starlink satellite-based internet project state that SpaceX’s self-sufficient city on Mars – a plan announced by Musk last week – will be ruled by ‘self-governing principles.’

‘For services provided on Mars, or in transit to Mars via Starship or other colonisation spacecraft, the parties recognise Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities,’ it reads. ‘Accordingly, disputes will be settled through self-governing principles, established in good faith, at the time of Martian settlement.’

Starlink is a network of satellites currently being launched into orbit in order to provide a global internet connection for Earth. More than 800 are already cluttering space, with tens of thousands yet to come. A similar network would probably serve Mars.

While Musk’s company will declare ‘Martian Law’ on the Red Planet, Earthlings using Starlink will be governed by the laws of the State of California.
